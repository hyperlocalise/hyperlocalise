# Automation knowledge memories

## Problem

Workspace automations can use GitHub, Contentful, translation, Slack, and email
tools, but they cannot opt into the organization knowledge base. Teams already
edit that guidance under **Knowledge**; automations should reuse it as a
built-in tool with manage/edit in the automation UI.

## Decision

Treat organization knowledge memory as a built-in automation tool named
**Memories**.

- Store opt-in in `toolConfig.knowledge: { enabled: boolean }`.
- Show **Memories** under a **Built-in** group in Add Tool.
- When enabled, show a Tools row with **Manage** and remove.
- **Manage** opens a sheet that reuses `KnowledgeMemoryEditor`.
- Gate adding Memories on the `workspace-knowledge` flag and
  `workspace:update` for edits (same as the Knowledge page).
- At run time, when enabled, select relevant knowledge and append it to
  composed orchestrator instructions. Do not add a forced orchestrator tool
  call; knowledge guides other planned tools.
- Memories alone does not count as an activatable workflow tool.

## Behavior

1. User adds **Memories** from Add Tool → Built-in.
2. Tools list shows Memories with **Manage** and delete.
3. **Manage** edits the shared org knowledge markdown memory.
4. On run, if `toolConfig.knowledge.enabled`, load memory, select context from
   automation name/instructions, and inject under `## Workspace knowledge`.

## Out of scope

Per-automation private memories, translation-memory (TM) tools, outbound MCP
servers, and forcing a `consult_knowledge_memory` tool step.
